# Store-ify
A web store framework with a React.js interface and Python API.

## Usage
First ensure git submodules are also correctly cloned.

To setup the server first install `mongodb` followed by `requirements.py` to a virtualenv located at `store.py/.env` and then run `make api` inside the `store.py` folder.

To setup the front end install the requirements using `yarn` or `npm install` then run the start scripts, this is in the `store.js` folder.
